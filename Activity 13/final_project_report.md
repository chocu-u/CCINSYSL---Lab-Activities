---

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Acquisition and Generation

#### 2.1.1 Data Source Description

The investigation utilized simulated rental transaction data designed to replicate real-world car rental operations including normal transactions, late returns, and fraudulent activities.

**Primary Data Fields:**
- `rental_id`: Unique transaction identifier (R00001-R00500)
- `customer_name`: Customer identification (with intentional formatting inconsistencies)
- `rent_out_timestamp`: Rental initiation timestamp
- `return_timestamp`: Actual vehicle return timestamp (missing for non-returns)
- `rental_duration_hours`: Expected rental duration (1-72 hours)
- `actual_duration_hours`: Actual rental duration
- `vehicle_make_model`: Vehicle identification (8 models)

**Data Generation Process:**
The dataset was synthetically generated using `generate_data.py` to simulate realistic rental patterns:
- 85% normal rentals (within 0.5x to 1.5x expected duration)
- 13% late returns (1.5x to 6x expected duration)
- 2% extremely late returns (6x to 40x expected duration)
- 3% non-returns (missing return timestamp, indicating potential theft)

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

#### 2.2.1 Data Quality Issues Identified

1. **Missing Return Timestamps**: 15 records (3%) with no return data
2. **Inconsistent Text Formatting**: Customer names in mixed case (UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case)
3. **Temporal Data Type Issues**: Timestamps stored as strings
4. **Implicit Fraud Indicators**: Non-returns not explicitly flagged

#### 2.2.2 Cleaning Procedures Applied

**Script Used**: `preprocess_data.py`

**Step 1: Type Conversion**
```python
- Converted rent_out_timestamp and return_timestamp to datetime objects
- Converted rental_duration_hours and actual_duration_hours to float type
- Handled conversion errors with coercion to maintain data integrity
```

**Step 2: Missing Data Handling**
```python
- Created 'non_return' boolean flag for missing return timestamps
- Assigned default actual_duration_hours = 999.0 for non-returns
- Preserved data integrity while enabling mathematical operations
```

**Step 3: Feature Engineering**
```python
- Duration_Difference = actual_duration_hours - rental_duration_hours
- hour_of_day = Extraction from rent_out_timestamp (0-23)
- is_weekend = Boolean flag for Saturday/Sunday rentals
- customer_name_clean = Standardized to Title Case format
```

**Step 4: Anomaly Scoring**
```python
- Calculated anomaly_score based on normalized Duration_Difference
- Applied threshold: anomaly_score > 3.0 flagged as anomalous
- Additional weighting (+10) for non-returns
```

**Output Files:**
- `final_project_cleaned_data.csv`: 500 cleaned records with 14 columns
- `final_project_anomalies.csv`: 53 initially flagged anomalous records

### 2.3 Intelligent Analysis: Machine Learning Anomaly Detection

#### 2.3.1 Algorithm Selection: Isolation Forest

**Rationale**: Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm particularly effective for anomaly detection in high-dimensional data. It works by isolating observations through random partitioning, with anomalies requiring fewer partitions to isolate.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Script**: `analyze_data.py`
- **Algorithm**: sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest
- **Contamination Parameter**: 0.1 (expecting ~10% anomalies)
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)
- **Estimators**: 100 decision trees

#### 2.3.2 Feature Selection

**Primary Features for ML Model:**
1. **Duration_Difference** (continuous): Actual - Expected rental hours
2. **hour_of_day** (discrete): Rental start time (0-23)

**Feature Preprocessing:**
- StandardScaler normalization applied to ensure equal weighting
- 500 records with complete data used for training

#### 2.3.3 Model Training and Prediction

```python
Model Configuration:
- Training Data: 500 records with normalized features
- Prediction Output: Binary classification (1=Normal, -1=Anomaly)
- Anomaly Score: Continuous score indicating isolation difficulty

Results:
- 52 anomalies detected (10.4% of dataset)
- Successfully identified all 15 non-returns as anomalous
- Additional 37 extreme late returns flagged
```

### 2.4 Visualization Strategy

A scatter plot visualization was created to illustrate the relationship between rental timing and duration anomalies:

**Visualization Design:**
- **X-axis**: Hour of Day (rental start time: 0-23)
- **Y-axis**: Duration Difference (actual - expected hours)
- **Color Coding**: Blue (normal rentals), Red (anomalies)
- **Statistical Overlay**: Summary statistics text box
- **Reference Line**: Y=0 line indicating expected duration

**Output**: `final_project_chart.png` (300 DPI, professional quality)
