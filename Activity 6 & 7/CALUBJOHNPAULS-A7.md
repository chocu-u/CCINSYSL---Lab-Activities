# Forensic Investigation Report
 
## Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of a comprehensive forensic analysis conducted on system logs. Through automated anomaly detection and entity extraction, we identified 100 anomalous events and extracted 133 key entities for further investigation.
 
## Methodology
The investigation followed a systematic approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Raw log data was cleaned and standardized
2. **Feature Engineering**: Additional analytical features were created
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical methods identified unusual patterns
4. **Entity Extraction**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) using SpaCy extracted key entities
 
## Key Findings
 
### Anomaly Analysis
- Total anomalous events detected: **100**
- Most common anomalous event type: **login** (25 occurrences)
- Investigation period: 100 suspicious activities flagged
 
### Entity Extraction Results
- Total entities extracted: **133**
- Entity types found: CARDINAL, PERSON, ORG, GPE
- Key persons of interest: 45 individuals identified
- Geographic locations: 15 locations flagged

## Conclusion
The automated analysis has successfully identified patterns and entities requiring further investigation. The anomaly detection system flagged 100 events for manual review, while entity extraction provided 133 potential leads.
 
## Recommendations
1. Prioritize investigation of the most frequent anomalous event types
2. Cross-reference extracted entities with known databases
3. Conduct deeper analysis on flagged time periods
4. Implement continuous monitoring based on identified patterns
