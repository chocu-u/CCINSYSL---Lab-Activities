# Final Project Plan - Digital Forensics Investigation Pipeline

## Summary of Progressive Project (Weeks 1-6)

Throughout the first six weeks of the course, I developed a comprehensive digital forensics investigation pipeline that processes raw evidence data through multiple analytical stages:

### Week 1-2: Data Acquisition and Cleaning
- **Activity 1**: Created a data generation script that simulated realistic forensic evidence including timestamps, user activities, event types, and system messages
- **Activity 2**: Implemented data cleaning procedures to handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare the dataset for analysis
- **Key Output**: Clean, structured dataset ready for advanced analysis

### Week 3: Feature Engineering
- Enhanced the cleaned dataset by extracting temporal features (hour of day, day of week, weekend indicators)
- Created additional analytical dimensions to support pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- **Key Output**: Feature-enriched dataset with enhanced analytical capabilities

### Week 4-5: Intelligent Analysis
- **Activity 4**: Implemented anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual patterns in system behavior
- **Activity 5**: Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) using SpaCy to extract entities (persons, organizations, locations, IP addresses) from log messages
- **Key Outputs**: Anomalies flagged for investigation and structured entity database

### Week 6-7: Visualization and Reporting
- **Activity 6**: Created data visualizations showing the distribution of anomalous events
- **Activity 7**: Generated comprehensive forensic investigation reports combining statistical findings, entity analysis, and visual representations
- **Key Outputs**: Professional forensic report with actionable insights and supporting visualizations

**Description**: This dataset represents evidence from a suspected corporate data breach, containing network traffic logs, file access records, database queries, and system process information. The data includes both internal and external IP addresses, user authentication events, file system access patterns, and suspicious network communications.

### Step-by-Step Data Cleaning Plan

1. **Data Validation and Type Conversion**
   - Convert timestamp strings to datetime objects
   - Validate IP address formats (IPv4/IPv6)
   - Convert data_size_bytes to numeric type
   - Standardize user account naming conventions

2. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Identify missing values in critical fields (timestamp, source_ip, user_account)
   - Implement appropriate strategies: forward-fill for session continuity, median imputation for data sizes
   - Flag records with excessive missing data for manual review

3. **Data Standardization**
   - Normalize file paths to consistent format (forward vs. back slashes)
   - Standardize process names and command line arguments
   - Geocode IP addresses for consistent location data
   - Create categorical encodings for action_type and network_protocol

4. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Remove duplicate records based on composite key (timestamp + source_ip + user_account)
   - Validate timestamp ranges and identify temporal anomalies
   - Cross-reference user accounts with authorized user database
   - Flag suspicious IP addresses against threat intelligence feeds

### Intelligent Analysis Plan

#### 1. Multi-Layer Anomaly Detection
- **Temporal Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual activity patterns outside normal business hours
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Detect users performing actions inconsistent with their typical behavior
- **Network Anomaly Detection**: Flag unusual network traffic patterns and suspicious IP communications
- **Volume Anomaly Detection**: Identify abnormal data transfer volumes

#### 2. Advanced Entity Extraction and Classification
- **IP Address Intelligence**: Extract and classify IP addresses (internal/external, geographic location, threat reputation)
- **File Path Analysis**: Extract sensitive file types, directory structures, and access patterns
- **User Behavior Profiling**: Extract and classify user actions, privilege escalations, and access patterns
- **Process and Command Analysis**: Extract malicious process indicators and suspicious command patterns

#### 3. Correlation Analysis
- **User-to-Resource Mapping**: Correlate users with accessed resources to identify unauthorized access
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Create chronological event sequences to understand attack progression
- **Network Communication Analysis**: Map communication patterns between internal and external systems

### Visualization Strategy

#### 1. Executive Dashboard
- **Risk Score Heatmap**: Geographic distribution of high-risk activities
- **Timeline Visualization**: Interactive timeline showing breach progression
- **User Activity Matrix**: Visual representation of user-to-resource access patterns

#### 2. Technical Analysis Charts
- **Network Traffic Flow Diagrams**: Visual representation of data flow between systems
- **Anomaly Distribution Plots**: Statistical distribution of detected anomalies
- **Entity Relationship Networks**: Graph visualization of connections between users, files, and systems

#### 3. Investigative Visualizations
